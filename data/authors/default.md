I'm a freelance mobile/web developer from Virginia currently studying Computer
Science at Duke.

Programming has empowered me to not think about whether something is possible,
but whether I *wanted* to do something. It's taught me that in life, it's much
less about whether you believe you can do something, but moreso whether you
think it worth your time and is valuable. I want people to feel that power they
have, not just in code but in life. 

Often times we limit ourselves because we
don't think large enough since we don't know we are capable, you can 
do so much more than you can even believe.
