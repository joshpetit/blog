This is definitely the weirdest thing I've ever "celebrated". I noticed I was
hovering around the 3k contributions and knew I would hit it for a while,
especially with me being in a busy season with my projects.

This may not really be something to celebrate, since this 3k marker came with a
lot of inconsistencies. I wish I was at times more balanced in how I spent my
time, and rather then spending it all jsut coding spent it more on improving
myself. There are a lot of things I want to improve such as my relational
skills, becoming more ephathetic, reading more books on character development.
But I never really "found" time for it. Really, I just didn't find them useful
enough and would only do that when I found myself on a long car ride and had a
few podcasts queued up.

This isn't to say I spent too much time coding, but to say I didn't spend enough
time trying to develop myself. Wherever the time must come from, I should've
looked for it.


But hey, we hit 3k, ðŸ¥³.
